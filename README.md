# JIN - Additional Memory (takehirotei remix) -  osu! storyboard

A repository for the storybrew project used for [Mekakucity Showdown Grand Finals Tiebreaker's storyboard](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2174126).

This storyboard is a mess LMFAO but that's what going to happen when you have a few days and barely enough experience with storyboarding as a whole ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Fonts used:
 - [Akira Expanded](https://www.dafont.com/akira-expanded.font) - For the intro texts and mappers name
 - [Tsunagi Gothic](https://www.freejapanesefont.com/tsunagi-gothic-black-download/) - For the lyrics
 - [Nautilus Pompilius](https://www.1001fonts.com/nautilus-pompilius-font.html) - For the end credits
